* cl-webkit - WebKitGTK+ binding for Common Lisp

** About
 cl-webkit is a binding to [WebKitGTK+] for Common Lisp, currently
 targeting WebKit version 2.  The WebKitGTK+ library adds web browsing
 capabilities to an application, leveraging the full power of the
 WebKit browsing engine.

** API overview
The cl-webkit API closely follows the WebKit2 API, with the exception
that class based interfaces are preferred over functional interfaces
in cases where both are provided.

That is, ~*_{new,get,set}~ methods are excluded in favour of
~make-instance~ and slot accessors wherever possible.

For documentation on how to use the WebKit2 API, please refer to the C
API documentation.

Backwards compatibility (with older WebKit2 API versions) is not a
priority.  The binding targets the latest version of Webkit2Gtk+
available on mainstream distributions.

** Dependencies
- A working installation of WebKit2GTK+ (whichever package provides
  ~libwebkit2gtk-4.0.so~, e.g., ~libwebkit2gtk~ on Debian).
- A [CFFI] compatible Common Lisp implementation.  The package is
  developed using [SBCL] but should work on any implementation that
  supports CFFI.
- A recent checkout of [cl-cffi-gtk]

** Installation
Assuming you have [Quicklisp] installed, do

1. Clone to =~/common-lisp/quicklisp/local-projects/cl-webkit=
2. > lisp
3. > (ql:quickload :cl-webkit2)

*** Testing
To run tests, you need to additionally install [[https://github.com/hawkir/calispel][Calispel]],
[[https://github.com/Shinmera/float-features][float-features]] and [[https://github.com/lispci/fiveam][FiveAM]] (all of these are available via
Quicklisp). After that, simply running =(asdf:test-system :cl-webkit2)=
should be enough.

** Change Log
*** 3.0.0
- Make =webkit-web-view-evaluate-javascript= process the returned values
  and turn them into the matching Lisp values (see =jsc-value-to-lisp=
  docstring for transformation rules).
- The callback to the =webkit-web-view-evaluate-javascript= now accepts
  two required arguments -- the Lispy data, transformed from the
  results of code evaluation, and an original [[https://webkitgtk.org/reference/jsc-glib/2.32.1/JSCValue.html][JSCValue]] it was
  transformed from.
- Add tests (webkit2/tests/ subdirectory and =cl-webkit2/tests= system),
  mostly for JS evaluation results.
